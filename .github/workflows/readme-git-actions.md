# GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration Guide

## Event Triggers
In line 2, the keyword "on" signifies an event trigger for initiating the workflow. Events can include various actions to trigger the workflow.

## Action Execution
Line 8 employs the reserved word "run" to execute actions. Actions represent applications responsible for performing recurring tasks. When defining actions, the keyword "uses" is utilized.

For more configuration options regarding actions, refer to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout).

## Job Execution Control
If parallel job execution is required, no additional code is necessary. However, for sequential pipeline execution, the "needs" keyword is utilized to establish dependencies between jobs. If a job fails, the entire workflow is halted.

## Pipeline Context
Within the Pipeline context, the "trigger" property plays a crucial role. It allows the user to determine the execution behavior of the pipeline. Multiple triggers can be added to a single workflow.

## GitHub Context
The GitHub context provides access to essential information within GitHub repositories, including PR details, references, and commits. Utilizing the GitHub context, users can incorporate relevant information into their workflow steps or other jobs. Refer to the example expressions in `output.yml` and `test_coverage.yml` for more details.
